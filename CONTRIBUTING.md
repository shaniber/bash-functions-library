# How to contribute

I will review PRs and suggestions, though I won't guarantee that I'll reply with any speed to them. 

## Environment

You will need a modern version of Bash, and a text editor. Clone the repo, and then run the tests to see that you're able to use the library:

```
./bash-functions-library-tests.sh
```

## Bug Reports

Please try to create bug reports that are reproducible, unique, and specific. Include the version of Bash you're using, your platform, and your OS version.

## Pull Requests

Fork, create a feature branch, commit your changes, push back to your fork, and [open a PR](https://github.com/shaniber/bash-functions-library/compare?expand=1).
